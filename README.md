## Revolutionizing the murder market

Deadline is committed to disrupting the assassination market with a platform for mercenaries to take charge of their work. We aim to empower hitmen to claim independence from corporate interests and to redefine the 'client-assassin-target' relationship. Deadline plans to create a fair and frictionless free marketplace to connect hitmen with potential clients, allowing them to grow a personal brand, have higher job satisfaction and more satisfied returning customers.
